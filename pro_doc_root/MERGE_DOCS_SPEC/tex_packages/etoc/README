ABSTRACT


The etoc package gives to the user complete control on how the entries
of the table of contents should be constituted from the _name_,
_number_, and _page number_ of each sectioning unit. This goes via the
definition of _line styles_ for each sectioning level used in the
document. The package provides its own custom line styles. Simpler ones
are given as examples in the documentation. The simplest usage will be
to take advantage of the layout facilities of packages dealing with list
environments.

Regarding the _global toc display_, etoc provides pre-defined styles
based on a multi-column format, with, optionally, a ruled title or
framed contents.

The \tableofcontents command may be used arbitrarily many times and it
has a variant \localtableofcontents which prints tables of contents
'local' to the current surrounding document unit. An extension of the
\label/\ref syntax allows to reproduce (with another layout) a local
table of contents defined somewhere else in the document.

Via _depth tags_, one gets an even finer control for each table of
contents of which sectioning units it should, or not, display.

The formatting inherited (and possibly customized by other packages)
from the document class will be used when in compatibility mode.

The assignment of levels to the sectioning units can be changed at any
time, and etoc can thus be used in a quite general manner to create
custom ''lists of'', additionally to the tables of contents related to
the document sectioning units. No auxiliary file is used additionally to
the standard .toc file.



INSTALLATION


The simplest is to download

  http://mirrors.ctan.org/install/macros/latex/contrib/etoc.tds.zip

and then run unzip etoc.tds.zip -d <DEST> where <DEST> is a
TDS-compliant repertory.

Else, to extract the package (.sty) and driver (.tex) files from
etoc.dtx:

-   if etoc.ins is present: etex etoc.ins
-   without etoc.ins: etex etoc.dtx

It is also possible to run latex or pdflatex directly on etoc.dtx.

At least three ways to produce etoc.pdf (method (3) is preferred):

1.  latex etoc.dtx (four times), then dvips, then ps2pdf
2.  pdflatex etoc.dtx (four times)
3.  latex etoc.tex (four times), then dvipdfmx

Method (3) produces the smallest pdf files. Options can be set in
etoc.tex:

-   scrdoc class options (paper size, font size, ...)
-   with or without source code,
-   with dvipdfmx or with latex+dvips or pdflatex.

To produce etoc-DE.pdf (German documentation) run etex on etoc.ins or
etoc.dtx to produce etoc-DE.tex, then compile etoc-DE.tex with latex
(thrice) then dvipdmx, or set first to 0 \Withdvipdfmx in etoc-DE.tex to
allow compilation with pdflatex.

Um etoc-DE.pdf zu erzeugen ist latex dreimal mit etoc-DE.tex laufen zu
lassen, dann dvipdfmx mit etoc-DE.dvi. Im Falle von Problemen mit
dvipdfmx ist \Withdvidpdfmx auf 0 in etoc-DE.tex zu setzen, dann ist
pdflatex dreimal mit etoc-DE.tex laufen zu lassen.

Installation:

    etoc.sty    -> TDS:tex/latex/etoc/etoc.sty
    etoc.dtx    -> TDS:source/latex/etoc/etoc.dtx
    etoc.pdf    -> TDS:doc/latex/etoc/etoc.pdf
    etoc-DE.pdf -> TDS:doc/latex/etoc/etoc-DE.pdf
    README.md   -> TDS:doc/latex/etoc/README.md

The other files may be discarded.

RECENT CHANGES


v1.08b [2015/03/18]

Bug fixes:

-   extra space token removed from \localtableofcontents (showed only
    for inline TOCs.)
-   \etocpartname (a macro used by the package own default line styles)
    was defined to be \partname, but this is not compatible at least
    with babel+french context. Now simply expands to Part.
-   some problems fixed in the German documentation.
-   [2015/03/28] some more problems fixed in the documentation. Added
    mention of \etocarticlestyle and \etocbookstyle.


v1.08a [2015/03/13]

\etocname, \etocnumber and \etocpage are now the robust variants of
\etocthelinkedname, \etocthelinkednumber and \etocthelinkedpage. This
should arguably have been done since the addition of the latter to etoc
with v1.07f [2013/03/07]. The earlier \etocname etc... contained the
hyperlink destination only in an unexpanded form.

The documentation has a brand new title page and a new section _The TOC
as a TikZ mind map_ both illustrating further uses of etoc to display
tables of contents as trees in an automatic manner.


v1.08 [2015/03/10]

\etocskipfirstprefix may now appear anywhere in the <start> part of a
level style.

New commands \etociffirst, \etocxiffirst, \etocxifnumbered.

It is now possible to issue line style specifications directly with &
and \\ tokens, in order to typeset a TOC as a tabular or longtable with
the opening for example in the first argument of \etocsettocstyle and
the closing in its second argument.

It is mandatory for such uses to issue \etocglobaldefs which tells etoc
to proceed globally for certain definitions. This is also useful in the
context of the inline environments of package enumitem.

On this occasion, various old parts of the code have been improved.


v1.07n [2015/03/05]

No more use of \toks@ when etoc constructs \etocthelinkedname etc...
Thus \toks@ can be put in the line styles in order to accumulate
information. Only useful if it is certain nothing else will change
\toks@ either.

In the documentation: list of main commands now in alphabetic order.


v1.07m [2015/01/23]

Reading of .toc file is delayed to \begin{document} to account for
possible Babel active characters used therein. Thanks to Denis Bitouzé
who reported a Babel related problem.

Improved global toc display emulation under KOMA-script classes.

New command \etocbeforetitlehook. New command \etocdisplay.


v1.07l [doc of 2014/04/29]

Added to the documentation an example of use of \etocthelinkedname
together with an enumitem inline itemize* environment; moved main TOC to
immediately after the title, and license to the first pages.

Incorporation of the translation into German done on the initiative of
Christine Römer by Felix Baral-Weber, Jenny Rothkrämer-Vogt, Daniel
Büttner, Claudia Dahl, Christian Otto and Christine Römer (FSU Jena). My
grateful thanks to all!
